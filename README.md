# SQL-PROJECT-Bitcoin-vs.-the-Nation

🎯 Project Title:
“Bitcoin vs. the Nation: A Comparative Analysis of BTC Market Growth and New Zealand’s Institutional Balance Sheet (2013–2021)”

🧭 Mission Statement:
This project investigates the financial trajectory of Bitcoin (BTC) in comparison to the economic standing of New Zealand’s institutional sectors over the period 2013 to 2021. By comparing annual changes in BTC’s average market capitalization against the total balance sheet of the New Zealand economy (excluding the rest of the world), we aim to explore relative strength, yield potential, and macroeconomic correlation between decentralized digital assets and traditional financial systems.

📌 Primary Goal:
To measure and compare the annual growth rates of:

🪙 Bitcoin’s average market capitalization

🇳🇿 New Zealand’s institutional balance sheet (total economy excl. rest of world)

… in order to:

Evaluate relative investment performance

Detect correlation or decoupling trends

Contextualize movements with major global or crypto events

🧩 Key Research Questions:
Was Bitcoin a stronger investment vehicle than the national economy during this period?

Do significant changes in BTC valuation align with or diverge from changes in New Zealand’s economic position?

What macro or market events might explain the most significant deltas in performance or direction?

📊 Dataset Summary:
btc_prices (2013-04-29 to 2021-07-06): Daily BTC market data incl. open, close, high, low, marketcap, volume

balance_sheets (2007.03 to 2023.03): NZ institutional sectors with quarterly total asset values

major_events (manually inserted): Major disruptors like COVID-19, Bitcoin halving, government bans

⚙️ Tools & Technologies:
💾 MySQL: Data modeling and querying

🐍 Python (Pandas): Data cleaning and preprocessing

📊 Tableau: Visual storytelling (primarily for university paper)

✍️ Markdown + SQL: CS50 project structure

🔚 Expected Deliverables:
schema.sql — all table definitions and view structures

queries.sql — all key SELECT queries and analytics

DESIGN.md — documented scope, relationships, rationale, and limitations

(optional) Tableau dashboard for interactive presentation of findings
